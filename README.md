## Notes

This was one of my first times working with swift and Xcode. I was really impressed with Xcode's interface for creating UIs for iOS apps. Using storyboards was pretty simple. I'm still not comfortable with swift, so there were many times when I had to search something up. This was a great learning experience overall.
